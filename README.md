# Visualization-of-Airlines-and-Delays
The dataset contains data related to aircraft arrival delays (in mins) from 2015 to
2018. It contains details regarding airline services, airports, and reasons for the delays. The
column arr_delay is the total delays in mins. A delay event is calculated only when an aircraft
arrival is delayed by more than 15 mins. For example, an aircraft arrival delayed by 10 mins is
not recorded but an aircraft delayed by 18 mins is registered as 18 mins. So, the column
arr_delay is the total delay in mins for a particular airline at a particular airport. Note that
arr_delay=carrier_delay+weather_delay+nas_delay+security_delay+late_aircraft_delay.

The detailed explanation of the variables are given as follows
• Air Carrier: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within
the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage
loading, fueling, etc.).

• Extreme Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in
the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado,
blizzard or hurricane.

• National Aviation System (NAS): Delays and cancellations attributable to the
national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme
weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.

• Late-arriving aircraft: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the
present flight to depart late.

• Security: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, reboarding
of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or
long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.
